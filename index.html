          <li id="Factors_of_Safety" class="list-header">
            <h3>Factors of Safety</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>The factor of safety is the ratio between the designated working load limit (WLL) or safe working load (SWL) and the load the equipment is expected to fail at. Given the nature of body suspension, it is considered a "high risk situation". As we are flying people overhead, we (skindependent) employ a safety factor of <strong>12:1</strong>. Below are examples and different terminologies.</li>
              <li><h4>Design Factor</h4><br>
                The Design Factor (DF) is specified by a designer or manufacturer and this defines the factor applied to the MBS to determine maximum load acceptable for a component.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Safety Factor</h4><br>
                Safety Factor (SF) or Factor of Safety (FoS) is generally defined by industry rather than manufacturer.  It may be significantly different to DF.  For example, a particular connector may have a minimum break strength (MBS) of 50kN, a manufacturer specified DF of 4, but an industry specified SF of 10 when used for a particular application.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>WLL</h4><br>
                Working Load Limit (WLL) is a term used by manufacturers to indicate the maximum force that should be applied to an item in normal use, regardless of industry.  The ratio of MBS to WLL is referred to as the Design Factor (DF).  Many manufacturers specify a DF of 4, which implies a WLL of a quarter of the MBS.  Manufacturers state the WLL to ensure that the item is not subjected to significant fatigue and remains in the range of normal elastic deformation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>SWL</h4><br>
                Safe Working Load (SWL) is typically determined by dividing the MBS of an item by the Safety Factor (SF) required for a particular use.  As stated above, it's possible that an entertainment rigger may calculate a different SWL for a particular use of an item than the value determined by a rescue technician.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Example:</h4><br>
                A particular steel carabiner has a MBS of 50kN.  The manufacturer has specified a DF of 4 for this connector, regardless of use. This carabiner has a WLL of 12.5kN and this value should never be exceeded in normal use - regardless of industry or application.  If this value is exceeded, it should not fail below the MBS however it should then be removed from service and destroyed. An entertainment rigger working in a certain country is required by the industry code-of-practice to use a SF of 10 for flying performers, and thus determines the SWL of this carabiner is 50kN/10 = 5kN. <br>
                A rescue technician in another country is supposed to apply a SF of 5 to hardware, and thus determines a SWL of 50kn/5 = 10kN for an identical connector.

          <h3>Rigger Roles & Responsibilities:</h3>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <h4>Head Rigger</h4> - This person is responsible for the overall rigging of the suspension event - all rigging to be checked off by a head rigger prior to any suspension commencing. Any and all matters pertaining to rigging can be brought to the head rigger.
           </li>
           <li>
            <h4>Top Rigger</h4> - This person is responsible for the rigging of the hard point of the suspension and attaching any and all equipment of the load path from the ceiling to the bottom block.
           </li>
           <li>
            <h4>Ground Rigger</h4> - This person is responsible for spotting the top rigger on the ladder and must remain at the bottom of the ladder as a support until the top rigger has concluded their work and is safely back on the ground. They are also responsible for identifying any hazards that may be present under and around the area to be rigged.
           </li>
           <li>
            <h4>General Rigger</h4> - A crew member responsible for the general checking and oversight of any rigging in place, being vigilant to ensure the safety of everyone involved with the suspension(s) being facilitated.
           </li>
           <li class="skip italic">
           	It is the responsibility of all riggers to each have a safety knife and butane torch on their person in case of emergency. An LED torch should also be made available for any checking of overhead rigging and/or hook shifting.
           </li>
          </ol>
         </li>
         <li id="Setting_up_the_load_path">

           </li>
           <li>Once the ladder is carefully placed against the ceiling beam, top rigger to climb with ground rigger supporting the bottom rung.
           </li>
           <li>Top rigger to have protective mat for beam and black sling.
           </li>
           <li>Once at the ceiling hardpoint, check the beam for any abnormalities - specifically sharp burrs or anything that could compromise the hardware.
           </li>
           <li>Lay the mat over the beam, covering the edges and tape in place if needed.
           </li>
           <li>Choke the round sling on top of the mat and ensure it is secure.
           </li>
           <li>Return to the floor to collect remaining hardware (delta rapide and reeved pulley system).
           </li>
           <li>Attach the delta to the sling then attach the pulley system to the delta. Ensure there is no tension on the delta when threading the gate closed (remember to thread down).
           </li>
           <li>Once all is attached, have the head rigger double check all the attachment points in the load path.
           </li>
           <li>It is the responsibility of the head rigger to attach a <span class="green">GREEN</span> tag to the hard point where the load path begins, once all connections have been checked. This includes but is not limited to:
            <ol>            
             <li>Protective mat covering the beam - make sure is not moving around and is covering all edges</li>
             <li>Sling/Spanset - check it is evenly wrapped and not bunched</li>
             <li>Rapide - check gate is threaded down properly</li>
             <li>Pulley shackle - check pin is threaded and moused with a red cable tie properly</li>
             <li>Pulley sheaves - check the sheaves are moving freely</li>
             <li>Main line termination to the pulley becket - check figure 8 knot is tied correctly and is secure</li>
            </ol>    
           </li> 
          </ol>
         </li>
         <li id="Cord_Use">
          <h3>Cord Use:</h3>
          <ol>
           <li>
           	<h4>Single Use Cord</h4> - When selecting an appropriate cord for use with body suspension, a safety factor of 12:1 needs to be employed. This safety factor takes into account dynamic forces, peak load and terminations, however may not necessarily take into account shock loading - this can cause catastrophic failure and is to be avoided.
           </li>
           <li>
            <h4>Example 1:</h4> Cord with a <strong>minimum break strength</strong> of 350kg has a <strong>SWL</strong> of 29kgs per line
			<p>Weight of person / # of hooks = SWL per line. There are TWO lines per hook (up and down)</p>
			<p>e.g 80kg / 4 hooks = 20kg per hook / 2 lines = 10kg per working line <br>
			  (this means a cord with a MINIMUM of 10 kg SWL per line is required)</p>
			<p>Therefore, the cord in this example IS suitable for use.</p>
		   </li>
           <li>
			<h4>Example 2:</h4> Cord with a <strong>minimum break strength</strong> of 200kg has a <strong>SWL</strong> of 16kgs per line <br>
			Weight of person / # of hooks = SWL per line. There are TWO lines per hook (up and down) <br>
			e.g 100kg / 2 hooks = 50kg per hook / 2 lines = 25kg per working line <br>
			(this means a cord with a MINIMUM of 25kg SWL per line is required) <br>
			Therefore, the cord in this example is <strong>NOT</strong> suitable.
		   </li>
           <li>
            Other factors that should be considered when selecting single use cord:
            <ol>
			 <li>What the cord is made from</li>
			 <li>How well it holds knots, bends and hitches</li>
			 <li>How well the cord cuts / melts</li>
			 <li>How much friction the cord creates through eyelets</li>
			 <li>How durable the cord is</li>
			</ol>
		   </li>
		  </ol>
         </li>
         <li id="Terminations">
          <h3>Terminations:</h3>
          <ol>
		   <li class="skip">              
			There are many knots/hitches/bends that can be utilised for body suspension, however, below are the most commonly used ones:
           </li>    
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il3nCIfsrT0">Figure 8 follow through</a> - this is the strongest termination we use. Ideal for use on heavier dynamic loads with less attachments. This knot is also used to terminate to the beket of the top block in the pulley system.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ziGkUjmxVk">Clove Hitch</a> - Easily adjustable, perfect for use when a lot of points are being used and tension needs to be constantly adjusted. It is crucial however, that this knot be backed up with half hitches and a stopper knot as it can slip and cause failure.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9glfeKvEuyo">Double Fishermans</a> - this can be used to attach two open lengths together and also as a stopper knot.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rw6n_Qm194">Half Hitch</a> - this is primarily used to lock hitches/bends in place prior to applying a stopper knot.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6RkzUhFq4k">Alpine Butterfly</a> - used to create an anchor on an existing line, without decreasing the strength of the rope.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOJmiuKjhl4">Water Knot</a> - used to join two ends together to create a continuous loop.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ_EwFCzTvk">Midshipman's Hitch</a> - useful hitch for adjusting lines under tension.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xUOtbGPHzw">Prusik</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsMpEn5U1NA">French Prusik</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHMSF6Py8Yc">Autoblock</a> - used as a locking mechanism on a mainline, useful in many scenarios.

           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ssa22v4fxE">Round Turn and Two Half Hitches</a> - used ONLY in static suspensions  
           </li>
           <li>
           	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z51n_DyWEnQ">Scaffold Knot</a> - this is used primarily to terminate to the pulley beket (an alternative to the fig 8 follow through)
           </li>
           <li class="skip">
            It is imperative a general rigger double checks <strong>ALL</strong> terminations prior to commencement of the suspension.
           </li> 
          </ol>
         </li>
		 <li id="Hardware_selection_&_use">
		  <h3>Hardware selection & use:</h3>
          <ol>
           <li>
           	When selecting hardware for suspension, it is important to take into special consideration it's intended use and how it will work for your application. Certain hardware is designed for specific uses. Understand how they are designed and ensure their strength is suitable for your specific use. As a general rule of thumb - any single connector in the load path should have a MBS of 2000kg - 3000kg minimum (this means a SWL of 200kg/2kN minimum)<br><br>

           	Whatever hardware you choose, make sure it is fit for your purpose. If in doubt, consult with the manufacturer about your intended use.
           </li>
           <li>
            <h4>Round Slings / Spansets</h4><br>
	   	     Round, synthetic generally - how it is used affects the strength so make sure you read the label.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Connectors</h4><br>
			Popular connector options are aluminium carabiners, steel carabiners, maillon rapides and shackles. 
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Pulleys (Block and tackle style)</h4><br>
            Many pulley systems are available. Marine are quite popular due to their high strength to light weight ratio as well as their durability. Aluminium climbing pulleys are also lightweight, though they generally are designed a lot smaller.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Mainline Rope</h4><br>
			Different applications may require different rope types. Commonly used are static or semi-static ropes made from nylon or polyester. Common sizes are 10mm / 11mm / 12mm.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Swivels</h4><br>
			These need to be at least 23Kn - check also the intended use of the swivel before purchasing and ensure WLL is suitable.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Rig Plates</h4><br>
            Aluminium climbing plates are most suitable as these are rated for human load, are lightweight and are well finished. Custom steel and aluminium rigs can also be made to a suitable strength for human load.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Custom Fabrication</h4><br>
			This is something that needs very careful consideration. All custom fabrication needs to be engineered by a professional who understands the intended use of the custom piece, therefore made in such a way to withstand the forces imposed on it.
           </li>
           <li>
           	<h4>Hooks</h4><br>
            Different hooks are available for different uses. The style of suspension will determine the desired hook type. Open gape hooks are primarily for static/semi-static suspensions; semi-locking hooks for multi directional static or dynamic loads; and locking hooks for dynamic loads.
